### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [your-email@example.com]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment within 48 hours
- Assessment within 7 days
- Fix timeline based on severity

## Security Best Practices

When deploying SST Node API:

1. **Change default credentials** - Default admin/admin must be changed
2. **Use strong JWT_SECRET** - Generate a random 64+ character secret
3. **Firewall properly** - Only expose required ports
4. **Use HTTPS** - Deploy behind a reverse proxy with SSL
5. **Keep updated** - Apply security updates promptly
6. **Limit access** - Only give admin access to trusted users

## Known Security Considerations

- API key is transmitted in headers (use HTTPS)
- SQLite databases are file-based (secure file permissions)
- Server paths are configurable (validate in production)
