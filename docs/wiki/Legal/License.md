# License

This repository contains multiple license files. Before redistributing or publishing a build, make sure you understand which license applies to which parts.

## Primary license text

- `apps/api/LICENSE` contains the **SST - Non-Commercial Open Source License** text.

## Other license files

- `LICENSE.md` exists at the repository root and contains an MIT license notice.

## Important: clarify intent

Right now, having different license files in different locations can be confusing for contributors and users.

Recommended next step:

- Decide which license governs the entire repository (or clearly scope licenses per folder)
- Align:
  - root license file
  - `apps/api/package.json` `license` field
  - dashboard docs (which currently reference a `LICENSE` file)

If you want, I can help standardize this (without changing your intended terms).
