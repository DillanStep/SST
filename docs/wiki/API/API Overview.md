# API Overview

The Node API is the bridge between:

- SST mod JSON exports under `$profile:SST/`
- the dashboard (React web client)

It exposes HTTP endpoints for:

- players/online state
- inventories and inventory counts
- events and life events
- economy and archive stats
- admin commands (queued to JSON)
- Expansion config editing

## Authoritative reference

The full endpoint reference lives here:

- [apps/api/docs/API.md](../../../apps/api/docs/API.md)

This wiki section is a friendlier “how to use it” guide per feature area.
